##Program to calculate distance you can travel

#get the tanks size and store in the floating point variable size
#Add code here


#get the percent full the tank is and store in float variable percent
#Add code here


#get the miles per gallon the car gets and store in float variable mpg
#Add code here


#Calculate amount of gas and store in variable gas
#Add code here


#calculate the distance you can travel and store in variable distance
#Add code here


#calculate the distance you need to walk
#Add code here


#print result
if distance >= 200:
    print ('All set')
else:
    print ("Get ready to walk", round(walk, 1), 'miles')

## Output
## Enter tank size: 17
## Enter percent full: 30
## Enter gas mileage: 25
## Get ready to walk 72.5 miles
