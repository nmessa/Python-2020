## Lab Exercise 12/15/2020 Problem 5
## Author: 
## This program simulates a random walk and determines the maximum
## distance the turtle travels from home.  This is done for 3 trials

from turtle import *
import random, time
NUM_TRIALS = 3

#This function returns the maximum distance the Turtle wandered
#from home during it's walk
def randomWalk(t, steps, distance = 20):
    #Add code here
    

#Create a list to hold the maximum distance the Turtle
#wandered for each trial
#Add code here
    

#Create a Turtle object
#Add code here
    

#Run the experiment NUM_TRIALS times
#Reset the Turtle to it's home position after each trial
#Be sure to clear the Turtle each trial and put penup before
#moving Turtle to home position and putting pendown after
#getting to the home position
for i in range(NUM_TRIALS):
    #Add code here
    

#Calculate the average distance the Turtle wandered for each trial
#Add code here
    

#Print the results
print(maximums)
print ("Average Maximum distance away from home", round(averageMax,2))
