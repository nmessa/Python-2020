##Lab Exercise 9.22.2020 Problem 3
##Author: 
##This program calculates the area of a room given
##user-provided dimensions
##It also calculates the cost of the carpet

#get the width in feet of the room from the user as a float
#Add code here


#get the length in feet of the room from the user as a float
#Add code here


#get the cost of the carpet per square yard from the user as a float
#Add code here


#calculate the area  of the room in square feet
#Add code here


#convert square feet to square yards and store in variable areaSY
#Add code here


#calculate the cost of the carpet and store in variable carpetCost
#Add code here


#round the cost to 2 decimal places
#Add code here


#Output the results
print ('The room has an area of', area, 'square feet')
print ('The room has an area of', areaSY, 'square yards')
print ('The cost of carpeting the room is $' + str(carpetCost))


## Output
## What is the width of the room? 10
## What is the length of the room? 12
## What is the cost of carpet per square yard? 10
## The room has an area of 120 square feet
## The room has an area of 13.3333333333 square yards
## The cost of carpeting the room is $133.33
