# The last digit of 55 is 5, the last digit of 226 is 6, and the last
# digit of 5190 is 0, and the last digit of 5*6 = 30 is 0, which is
# equal to the last digit of 5190(0).

# The last digit of 12 is 2, the last digit of 215 is 5, and the last
# digit of 2142 is 2, and the last digit of 2*5 = 10 is 0, which is
